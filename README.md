# College System Project

This Java and JavaFX project implements a college system that includes features for administrators, lecturers, teacher assistants, and students. The system allows administrators to manage subjects, lecturers, and teacher assistants. Lecturers and teacher assistants can sign up, sign in, add marks and results to students, and manage subjects. Students can sign up, register in subjects, view their results, and calculate GPA.
